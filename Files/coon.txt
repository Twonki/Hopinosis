[voice over] 
The city isn't what it used to be. It all happened so fast. Everything went to crap.
It's like... everyone's sense of morals just... disappeared. 
Bad economy made things worse. 
[A shot of Tele's TV store  Closed until further notice due to BAD ECONOMY ] 
The jobs started drying up. Then the stores had to shut down. 
[a shadow runs across the screen, in a cape. Next scene: an alley looking towards the street. An Obama poster for CHANGE is shown, with WHEN? spray-painted over the word]
Then a black man was elected President. He was supposed to change things. 
[the shadow climbs up a pipe and runs across the roof of the building opposite the alley entrance] 
He didn't. 
[next shot is that of a street under a threatening red sky] 
As more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear. Dark times. 
The city needs protection. 
[another alley. An aluminum trash can falls over, spilling its contents. The shadow appears on a wall, larger than life, then runs away] 
There is an animal that lives by night, searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage. 
[A rain gutter is shown. The shadow runs across the screen again, closer to the camera] 
To clean out the trashcan of society I've chosen to become more than a man. 
[another rooftop. The camera finds the shadow and zooms in on it.] 
I'm the hero this town needs. I am... the Coon! 
[Cartman looks up to the sky, and graphics for  The Coon  pop up. Next scene, the Coon runs down a street and leaps onto the roof of a car] 
As the world plummets into despair the Coon fights to keep order intact. 
[he leaps off the car].
